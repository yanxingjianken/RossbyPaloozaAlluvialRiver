# Dedalus 2-D channel model — the deck-p.8 numerical model, rung 1

The group's vorticity-meander equations ([`../vorticity_meander/THEORY.md`](../vorticity_meander/THEORY.md))
solved as a genuine 2-D initial-value / eigenvalue problem in **Dedalus v3.0.5**, and the
user-requested experiment: **erodible-bank initial planforms = sinusoids of different
wavelengths, evolving freely**.

## Fidelity statement

Per the design requirement ("faithful to equations"), the discretized system is exactly the
THEORY.md system and nothing else: **linear** dynamics, the **two friction closures**
(`rayleigh` deck-literal / `momentum` Ikeda-consistent) as the only dissipation, **no
artificial hyperviscosity** (deliberately not implemented; Orr filamentation of the vorticity
continuum is handled by the fit-window rule `t ≤ 0.9·Ny/(4Dk*)` and resolution), the deck-p.7
bank law taken literally (relaxation toward the **centerline** value), analytic RNG-free
initial conditions (bank sinusoid + harmonic interior extension, ζ′(0)=0).

## Formulation (all d3 idioms verified by smoke test 2026-07-13)

RealFourier(x) × Chebyshev(y∈[−1,1]); bank fields ψb±(x,t) live on `(xbasis,)` as
**prognostic variables** — their equations carry `dt()` and the interior interpolation
`psi(y=0)` on the LHS; two tau fields lifted to `ybasis.derivative_basis(2)`. Everything is
linear and on the LHS ⇒ the stepper (RK222, fixed dt=0.02) runs fully implicit — no CFL, LU
factorizations cached. The EVP (1-D Chebyshev, complex128, `dt→−iω`, `dx→ik*`) **shares the
identical equation strings** via namespace rebinding. kx=0 is closed and regular (BC rows pin
the Poisson nullspace; the constant-offset gauge mode is invariant and never excited by
zero-mean seeds — asserted).

## Verification ladder (all hard-asserted, all green 2026-07-13)

| rung | result |
|---|---|
| self-test (`python channel_lib.py`, <2 min) | d3 EVP vs FD-GEP Richardson(201/401): **\|Δω\| ≈ 1e−10** (tol 5e−4); IVP fit vs EVP 0.01%; rigid banks neutral; varicose decays at exactly −E with c=0; purity channels (kx=0, varicose, off-mode) at 1e−15–1e−20 |
| `01_evp_sweep` | 6 deck parameter sets × 2 closures × 7 assert-k each: worst \|Δσ\| = **1.6e−8** vs Richardson GEP (tol 5e−4). The Dedalus model and `vorticity_lib`'s N-point GEP are the same continuum spectrum. |
| `02_single_k_ivp` | 8 runs (2 closures × k*∈{0.3,0.44,0.9,1.3}): σ, c within 1e−5–1e−4 absolute of the EVP, R²=1.000000; rigid control decays (σ=−0.051); dt-halving drift 0.003% |
| `03_multi_k_selection` | **the headline experiment**: ONE channel (Lx=20π) seeded with 15 bank sinusoids k*=0.1…1.5 → per-mode demodulation reproduces the whole dispersion relation (30/30 modes within tolerance): growth band k*²<2D, upstream c*<0 in-band, out-band decay |
| `04_momentum_flux` | ⟨u′v′⟩(y) profile matches the EVP eigenfunction to 1.2e−4; centre ratio −⟨v′ζ′⟩/⟨ζ′²⟩ = **(γ+σ)/2D exactly** (0.00% err, rayleigh; also the γ=0 twin — growth alone sustains the bank-ward momentum flux, sharpening the deck-p.6 statement which is the σ→0 forced limit). Momentum closure transports ~19% more than the rayleigh-balance value (report-only; its centre balance differs). |
| `05_anim_planform` | `planform_upstream.mp4`: ψ′ + banks at k*=0.15, measured crest tracker marching upstream against the flow, honest e^{σt} gain counter |

Physics delivered for "不同波长三角函数波" (fig05): long sinusoids inside k*²<2D grow while
propagating **upstream** (c* up to ≈ −0.6…−0.9 at k*=0.1); short ones decay; the winner is
k*_pk ≈ 0.5 (rayleigh) — and under the momentum closure the decaying short waves' phase speed
even crosses to slightly downstream, a closure-discriminating detail.

Nonlinear J(ψ′,ζ′) toggle; wavy-bank pressure drag via resolved boundary geometry (the
